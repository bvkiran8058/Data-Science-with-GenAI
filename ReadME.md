# Data Science with GenAI

Welcome to the **Data-Science-with-GenAI** repository! This project provides practical, hands-on resources for learning and applying data science using Generative AI, with examples across core Python data science libraries.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **EDA/**  
  Contains scripts, notebooks, and resources for exploring datasets using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques.

- **Numpy/**  
  Includes code, practice files, and cheat sheets for numerical computing and array manipulation with NumPy.

- **Pandas/**  
  Resources and hands-on examples for data manipulation and analysis using Pandas.

- **Visualisation/**  
  Demonstrates data visualization techniques using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.

- **data/**  
  Contains example datasets used throughout the notebooks and scripts in this project.

- **sql/**  
  SQL scripts and notebooks for performing data queries and manipulations on structured databases.

- **.gitignore**  
  Specifies files and folders ignored by Git version control.

- **requirements.txt**  
  Lists all Python dependencies required to run the scripts/notebooks in this repository.

- **Data science cheatsheet.pdf**  
  Quick reference PDF covering core concepts and commands in data science.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bvkiran8058/Data-Science-with-GenAI.git
   cd Data-Science-with-GenAI
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the folders:**  
   Open the notebooks or scripts in each folder (`EDA`, `Numpy`, `Pandas`, `Visualisation`, `sql`) to start learning with practical examples.

4. **Review the cheatsheet:**  
   Refer to `Data science cheatsheet.pdf` for quick guidance on key commands and library functions.
