Perfect 🎯 — since you already know **Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib**, we’ll move straight into **hands-on EDA practice**, structured **step-by-step** from **Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced**.

This roadmap will not only strengthen your EDA logic but also make you confident for data science interviews or projects.

## 🧭 Step-by-Step EDA Practice Projects (Beginner → Advanced)

---

### 🌱 **Stage 1: Beginner Level (Learn the EDA Framework)**

**Goal:** Build EDA discipline — knowing what to look for, how to summarize, and visualize.

#### 🧩 Dataset 1: *Titanic Dataset* (Kaggle)

**Concepts practiced:**

* Data loading and inspection (`.info()`, `.describe()`, `.isnull()`)
* Handling missing values
* Univariate analysis (histograms, bar plots)
* Bivariate analysis (e.g., survival vs. gender/class)
* Feature correlation heatmap
* Outlier detection using boxplots

**Tasks:**

1. Load dataset from CSV
2. Print shape, datatypes, and missing values
3. Handle nulls (fill/replace/remove)
4. Visualize:

   * Count of survivors by gender
   * Age distribution
   * Correlation heatmap
5. Write 3–5 insights at the end.

---

#### 🧩 Dataset 2: *Iris Dataset*

**Concepts practiced:**

* Basic summary statistics
* Pairwise feature relationships (`sns.pairplot`)
* Class-wise comparison (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

**Tasks:**

1. Load from `sklearn.datasets` or CSV
2. Compare means of features per species
3. Plot pairplot, violin plots
4. Draw conclusions about class separability.

---

### 🌿 **Stage 2: Intermediate Level (Wrangling + Visualization)**

**Goal:** Handle messy data and uncover patterns across numeric + categorical variables.

#### 🧩 Dataset 3: *Netflix Titles Dataset* (Kaggle)

**Concepts practiced:**

* Date-time feature extraction
* Text columns cleaning (split, strip, extract)
* Feature engineering (e.g., “Year added”, “Country count”)
* Countplots, pie charts, and word frequency plots
* Data aggregation (`groupby`, `pivot_table`)

**Tasks:**

1. Load data and parse “date_added” to datetime
2. Extract year, month, and visualize number of releases per year
3. Find top 10 countries producing content
4. Plot movie vs. TV show ratio
5. Create word cloud for directors/genres.

---

#### 🧩 Dataset 4: *Supermarket Sales Data*

**Concepts practiced:**

* Handling duplicates, outliers, and inconsistent entries
* Customer behavior and sales trends
* Grouped visualizations and percentage analysis

**Tasks:**

1. Analyze total sales by gender and branch
2. Check average rating per branch
3. Find correlation between total amount and quantity
4. Monthly sales trend line chart
5. Detect any anomalies in sales using boxplots.

---

### 🌾 **Stage 3: Advanced Level (Real-world messy EDA)**

**Goal:** Simulate industry-level exploratory analysis and storytelling with data.

#### 🧩 Dataset 5: *House Prices (Kaggle)*

**Concepts practiced:**

* Advanced correlation analysis
* Feature transformation (log scaling, encoding)
* Handling multicollinearity
* Outlier treatment using IQR
* Hypothesis-driven EDA

**Tasks:**

1. Explore numeric vs. categorical features
2. Identify top correlated features with sale price
3. Visualize continuous variables (scatterplots, KDEs)
4. Create correlation heatmap for top 10 features
5. Write hypothesis-driven insights (e.g., “Larger houses in certain neighborhoods sell for more”).

---

#### 🧩 Dataset 6: *COVID-19 Global Dataset*

**Concepts practiced:**

* Multi-source data merging (e.g., cases + population)
* Time-series EDA
* Rolling averages, trend detection
* Geographic data visualization (optional with `plotly` or `folium`)

**Tasks:**

1. Analyze trend of confirmed cases and deaths per country
2. Compute and visualize death rate by continent
3. Plot top 10 affected countries over time
4. Draw insights on containment success.

---

### 🌾 **Stage 4: Expert Level (End-to-End EDA + Storytelling)**

**Goal:** Combine cleaning, analysis, visualization, and presentation into one narrative.

#### 🧩 Dataset 7: *Indian Startup Funding Dataset*

**Concepts practiced:**

* Text normalization and regex cleaning
* Entity standardization (e.g., merging “Flipkart” & “Flipkart.com”)
* Temporal trend analysis
* Multi-variable EDA + storytelling
* Presenting insights as a report (Jupyter Notebook Markdown + visuals)

**Tasks:**

1. Clean investor names and company names
2. Extract funding rounds and amounts
3. Find which sector got most funding each year
4. Analyze trends in funding growth by city
5. End with a dashboard-style notebook of plots and insights.

## 🧰 Optional Tools to Add at Any Stage

| Tool                  | Use                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Seaborn**           | High-level, beautiful visualization       |
| **Plotly / Dash**     | Interactive dashboards                    |
| **pandas-profiling**  | Auto EDA summary                          |
| **Sweetviz / D-Tale** | Visual summary and variable relationships |
| **Missingno**         | Visual missing data patterns              |

---

## 🧠 Suggested Learning Flow

1. Do **Titanic** (warm-up, clean process).
2. Then **Netflix / Supermarket** (intermediate, messy data).
3. Move to **House Prices / COVID-19** (advanced statistical + time-series analysis).
4. Finally, **Indian Startup Funding** (storytelling project).
